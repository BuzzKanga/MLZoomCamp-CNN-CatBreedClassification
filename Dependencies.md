# Dependencies and Environment Management

## Using requirements.txt

An alternative way to set up the environment is use the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/BuzzKanga/MLZoomCamp-CNN-CatBreedClassification/blob/main/requirements.txt) file.  

This is done by running the following command:  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
