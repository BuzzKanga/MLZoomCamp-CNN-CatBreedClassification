Capstone Project for MLZoomCamp Course - Use CNN deep learning model to identify cat breeds

## Problem Description

This is a project about cats ... and who doesn't like cats :) 

Identifying a breed of a cat from an image can help owners identify the breed of cat if they don't already know. 

However, this project is to test the limits of a deep learning model and to determine if cat breeds look significantly different to a CNN model for it to be accurately determine which breed they are

Once the CNN model has been trained, a user will be able to submit a photograph of a cat and the model will try to identify which breed the cat is from a set of 20 breeds that the model is trained upon.
The model will not be sophisticated enough to identify if a cat is from a breed that is not from one of the 20 popular cat breeds used for training the model. This is a possible future enhancement for the model.

## Dataset

The dataset used is available from [Kaggle](www.kaggle.com) at the following url: [CatBreedsRefined-7k](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/doctrinek/catbreedsrefined-7k)

The breeds included are:
Abyssinian, American Curl, American Shorthair, Bengal, Birman, Bombay, Bristish Shorthair,  Egyptian Mau, Exotic Shorthair, Himalayan, Maine Coon, Manx, Munchkin, Norwegian Forest,  Persian , Regdoll, Russian Blue , Scottish Fold, Siamese , Sphynx.
